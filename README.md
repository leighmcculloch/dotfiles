# vim_dotfiles

A set of vim dotfiles that configure vim and install plugins.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/leighmcculloch/vim_dotfiles ~/.vim_dotfiles
cd ~/.vim_dotfiles
make install
```

Change the clone to directory if you wish to keep it somewhere else. Make install will symlink the necessary files to your home directory, and replace any existing symlinks.
