## Bash Commands

Run all commands with the `sandbox --allow-file-write . -- ` prefix.

## Git Branch

When starting work on a new issue, always create a new branch first. Use a concise, kebab-case branch name that describes the changes (max 5 words).

When needing to update a branch, if the branch is not pushed rebasing is fine. If the branch is pushed to a remote, never rebase, only merge.

## Git Commit

Commit after every change immediately, without asking for confirmation for what to use as the commit message. Use a concise, commit message that says in present tense with imperative mood what has changed without saying why (max 50 characters). Do not use convention commit format. Start the commit message with a lower case letter and do not end with a full stop. Avoid generic phrases.
